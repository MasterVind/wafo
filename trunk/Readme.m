%README New features, bug fixes, and changes in WAFO Toolbox - Wave Analysis for Fatigue and Oceanography 
% Version 2.1.1   07-Sep-2005
%
%  FIXES
%  ~~~~~
%   o Some minor bugfixes in the fatigue part. 
%   o Removed all ':' from the 'See also' lines in all m-files, because
%     the ':' obstructed the possibility for clicking on the links in the
%     'See also' line in matlab 7. 
%   o Many new wavemodels are available in the WAVEMODELS directory.
%   o Some minor bugfixes in WSTATS, SPEC, KDETOOLS DATA and MISC
%     directories.
%   o The HTML based documentation can be launched from matlab by typing
%     wafohelp.
%
%   NEW FUNCTIONS
%   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%   o New functions for computing level crossings for noncentral Chi^2
%     processes in TRGAUSS directory.
%   o Some new functions in the CYCLES and WSIM directories

%  SHORT HISTORY
%  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%  The base for the WAFO toolbox was the Wave Analysis Toolbox (WAT)
%  and the Fatigue Analysis Toolbox (FAT). 
%  Several new functions exist along with enhancements of the old 
%  WAT and FAT functions. The enhancements also include a more consistent 
%  naming convention for the m-files.
%  Most of the functions in WAFO are incompatible with the functions
%  of WAT and FAT.
